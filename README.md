Simple Shell Project
Welcome to the Simple Shell Project! This project is an implementation of a basic Unix shell in C, designed to provide a simple and interactive command-line interface. The shell supports various command executions, built-in commands, and basic shell functionalities.

Features:
Command Execution: Run external commands by entering the command name.
Built-in Commands: Includes built-in commands like cd, help, and exit.
Input/Output Redirection: Redirect input and output streams using < and > operators.
Piping: Pipe multiple commands together to create more complex command sequences.
Signal Handling: Capture and handle signals such as Ctrl+C and Ctrl+Z.
